  <h2>Who am I</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a software engineer who loves solving problems and creating things that
    people can actually use. From web apps to backend systems, I enjoy the
    challenge of turning an idea into something functional. I'm always learning
    and looking for new ways to improve. Whether I'm diving into new
    technologies, optimizing workflows, or collaborating with others, I'm all
    about making things better, faster, and more efficient. If you're looking
    for someone who's passionate about tech and loves making a real impact,
    that's me.
